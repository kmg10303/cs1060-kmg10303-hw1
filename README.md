## What I worked on

Most of my work was fixing a few UI errors that the AI had trouble noticing, such as double layered text and overflowing divs. The AI also tried to sneak by without using an API and just faked a few articles and political leanings.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge was getting a good amount of news sources while still being able to keep track of the general political leanings of each news source. Because of this, I could only use a select number of news sources.
